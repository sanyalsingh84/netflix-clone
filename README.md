# REACT NETFLIX CLONE

## Description

This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, i used Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I built this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling we implement. i used Fuse.js for live search. I used React router for navigation!
